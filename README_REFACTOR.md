# AI Code Mentor - Refactor Branch

This branch contains refactored code to improve maintainability and eliminate runtime errors.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Path Selection Logic
- **Fixed TypeError**: Eliminated race conditions in custom path creation
- **Guest Support**: Guest users can now create and access custom paths from localStorage
- **Unified Behavior**: Consistent path switching for both guest and logged-in users
- **Path Validation & Repair**: Automatic validation and repair of corrupted custom paths

### 2. Safety Guards
- **Array Operations**: All `.filter()`, `.map()`, `.flatMap()` operations now have guards
- **Type Safety**: Added validation for learning path data structures
- **Null Checks**: Safe access patterns throughout components
- **Automatic Repair**: Corrupted custom paths are automatically repaired when possible

### 3. Code Organization
- **Services Layer**: Extracted path management and storage logic
- **Custom Hooks**: Path management logic moved to reusable hooks
- **Utilities**: Common safety functions centralized

```

## Changes Summary

### App.tsx
- Refactored `handleSelectPath` for better guest/user support
- Redesigned `handleCreateCustomPath` to eliminate race conditions
- Added comprehensive safety checks using service layer
- Integrated new storage service for better data management

### LearningPathView.tsx
- Added default empty arrays for all props
- Safe access patterns for modules, lessons, and steps
- Preserved all existing functionality

### Services
- **pathService.ts**: 
  - Centralized path management logic
  - Enhanced `validateLearningPath` with flexible validation for custom paths
  - Added `repairLearningPath` function to fix corrupted data
  - Added `findPathByIdWithRepair` with automatic repair attempts
- **storageService.ts**: Abstracted storage operations

### Hooks
- **usePathManagement.ts**: 
  - Reusable path logic with repair-enabled path finding
  - Better error handling and logging

### Utils
- **guards.ts**: Safety utilities for array operations

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed: Custom Path Structure Validation Error

**Problem**: Custom paths created earlier were failing validation with error:
```
Path with id "custom-1761971241754" has invalid structure.
```

**Root Cause**: 
- Strict validation in `validateLearningPath` was rejecting custom paths with different structures
- No mechanism to repair corrupted or incomplete path data

**Solution**:
1. **Enhanced Validation**: Made `validateLearningPath` more flexible for custom paths
2. **Automatic Repair**: Added `repairLearningPath` function to fix common structure issues
3. **Repair Integration**: `findPathByIdWithRepair` attempts validation first, then repair if needed
4. **Better Logging**: Detailed console logs for validation failures and repair attempts

**Technical Details**:
- Custom paths can now have empty modules arrays (for new paths)
- Missing required fields are automatically filled with defaults
- Corrupted lesson/step data is normalized with safe fallbacks
- Validation logs specific failure reasons for debugging

## Testing

Test scenarios that should now work without errors:
1. ✅ Create custom learning path → immediate selection works
2. ✅ Guest users can create and switch between custom paths
3. ✅ Logged-in users can switch between standard and custom paths
4. ✅ Page refresh preserves custom paths (localStorage/Firestore)
5. ✅ **FIXED**: Existing custom paths with validation issues are automatically repaired
6. ✅ No more `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')` errors
7. ✅ No more `Path has invalid structure` errors

## Migration from Main

This branch is fully compatible with main and adds improvements:
- ✅ All existing features preserved
- ✅ UI/UX unchanged
- ✅ Data compatibility maintained
- ✅ Performance improvements
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ **NEW**: Automatic repair of corrupted custom paths

## Error Resolution

### Before (Errors)
```
Path with id "custom-1761971241754" has invalid structure.
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')
```

### After (Fixed)
```
Path validation failed: missing id or title
Attempting to repair path 'custom-1761971241754'...
Successfully repaired path 'custom-1761971241754'
Successfully selected path: My Custom Learning Path
```

## Future Enhancements

- Path import/export functionality
- Batch operations for path management
- Advanced validation rules
- Offline sync capabilities
- Path versioning and migration system
