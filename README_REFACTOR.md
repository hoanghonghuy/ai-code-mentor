# AI Code Mentor - Refactor Branch

This branch contains refactored code to improve maintainability and eliminate runtime errors.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Path Selection Logic
- **Fixed TypeError**: Eliminated race conditions in custom path creation
- **Guest Support**: Guest users can now create and access custom paths from localStorage
- **Unified Behavior**: Consistent path switching for both guest and logged-in users

### 2. Safety Guards
- **Array Operations**: All `.filter()`, `.map()`, `.flatMap()` operations now have guards
- **Type Safety**: Added validation for learning path data structures
- **Null Checks**: Safe access patterns throughout components

### 3. Code Organization
- **Services Layer**: Extracted path management and storage logic
- **Custom Hooks**: Path management logic moved to reusable hooks
- **Utilities**: Common safety functions centralized

```

## Changes Summary

### App.tsx
- Refactored `handleSelectPath` for better guest/user support
- Redesigned `handleCreateCustomPath` to eliminate race conditions
- Added comprehensive safety checks

### LearningPathView.tsx
- Added default empty arrays for all props
- Safe access patterns for modules, lessons, and steps
- Preserved all existing functionality

### Services
- **pathService.ts**: Centralized path management logic
- **storageService.ts**: Abstracted storage operations

### Hooks
- **usePathManagement.ts**: Reusable path logic

### Utils
- **guards.ts**: Safety utilities for array operations

## Testing

Test scenarios that should now work without errors:
1. Create custom learning path → immediate selection works
2. Guest users can create and switch between custom paths
3. Logged-in users can switch between standard and custom paths
4. Page refresh preserves custom paths (localStorage/Firestore)
5. No more `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')` errors

## Migration from Main

This branch is fully compatible with main and adds improvements:
- ✅ All existing features preserved
- ✅ UI/UX unchanged
- ✅ Data compatibility maintained
- ✅ Performance improvements
- ✅ Better error handling

## Future Enhancements

- Path import/export functionality
- Batch operations for path management
- Advanced validation rules
- Offline sync capabilities
